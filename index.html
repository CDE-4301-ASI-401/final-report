        <h2>1. Singapore Amazing Flying Machine Competition 2025</h2>
        <p>
          Our group is participating in Singapore Amazing Flying Machine Competition (SAFMC) 2025 Open Category (Category E). In this category, we are required to design an autonomous drone swarm to search and rescue for victims in a given area.
          <br/><br/>
          Drone swarms have been used in a variety of real-world implementations, including environmental mapping and search and rescue. Defence Science Organisation (DSO), the organiser of the competition, stands to gain technical know-how from organising this competition. This can be applied in their development of drone systems for defence.
        </p>

        <h3>1.1 Category E Mission</h3>

        <p>
          The mission of SAFMC 2025 Category E is: <br/><br/>

          <i>Design a system of <b>10 to 25 drones</b> to navigate through an <b>indoor environment</b> and search for victims,
          using either a <b>centralised</b> or <b>de-centralised</b> <u>fully autonomous control system</u>. The system must possess
          <b>localization</b>, <b>obstacle sensing</b> and <b>obstacle avoidance</b> capabilities.</i>

        <h3>1.2 Playing Field</h3>
        <p>
          Figure 1.3 shows how the Arena this year will look like, which is not drawn to scale. Furthermore, the Danger Zones, Regular Victims and Bonus Victims may not be placed exactly where it is depicted in Figure 1.3. There is a maximum of two simultaneous take-offs of two runs per team. For each run, the placement of Danger Zones, Regular Victims and Bonus Victims may change. 
        </p>

        <image-component tag="image" source="./assets/section-1-safmc2025/figure_1_1_SAFMC_2025_playing_field.png"
                         subtitle="Figure 1.1: Indoor Arena of SAFMC 2022"></image-component>

        <p>
          Figure 1.4 shows the dimensions of the key elements within the Arena.
        </p>

        <p>
          The Arena has a size of 20 m x 14 m. The Start Area (green) has a size of 20 m x 6 m.
          </p>
        
        <p>
          The Start Area is where the Crazyflies would take off from to start the mission. There is no limit to the number of Navigation Aids that can be used within the Start Area.
          </p>

        <p>
          For our analysis, we split the Arena into three sections: (1) Known Search Area (grey). (2) Unknown Search Area (yellow). (3) Pillar Area.
          </p>

      </div>

        subtitle="Figure 1.2: Known Search Area"></image-component>  

        <p>
          The Known Search Area (grey) have the dimensions of 20 m x 14 m, which is the largest area in the Arena. The Known Search Area (Figure 1.5) will have Inner Walls of 2 m thickness and 2 m height, as well as Danger Zones, Regular Victims and Bonus Victims. The Inner Wall-to-Inner Wall distance is at least 2 m. There is a maximum of Ten Navigation Aids that can be used within the Arena (exclusive of the Unknown Search Area). 
          </p>

        subtitle="Figure 1.3: UnKnown Search Area"></image-component>  

        <p>
          The Unknown Search Area have the size of 8 m x 8 m and is situated in the centre of the Arena. The Unknown Search Area (Figure 1.6) contains Danger Zones, Inner Walls and Bonus Victims. There are two floor-to-ceiling entrances/exits to the Unknown Search Area.
          </p>
        
        <p>
          Navigation Aids are not allowed within the Unknown Search Area. Furthermore, the layout of the Unknown Search Area will not be revealed on Competition Day Mission.

        subtitle="Figure 1.4: Pillar Area"></image-component>

        <p>
          The Pillar Area (Figure 1.7) is the smallest area in the Arena. It consists of Eight Pillars Obstacles, with narrow paths (about 1 m wide) between the Pillar Obstacles. The Inner Wall-to-Pillar distance and the Pillar-to-Pillar distance is at least 1 m.
          </p>

        <p>
          Figure 1.7 shows a Bonus Victim situated within the Pillar Area, which highlights the importance of developing a unique algorithm capable of navigating the Pillar Area.

        subtitle="Figure 1.5: Specifications of Victim Markers"></image-component>

        <p>
          For SAFMC 2025, eight non-electronic markers will be used as Victim Markers. Figure 1.8 shows the general specifications of the Victim Markers, which must not exceed 30 cm x 30 cm x 1 m. Figure 1.8 does not show the actual Victim Marker we are using for the competition.
          </p>

        <p>
          Both Regular Victim and Bonus Victim will share the same type of Victim Markers. However, the Bonus Victim will be situated in areas that are more challenging to navigate. 
          </p>

        subtitle="Figure 1.6: Scoring Process (Rescue Victims)"></image-component>
        
        <p>
          To rescue a Victim, the Crazyflie needs to land within a 1 m radius of the Line of Sight (LOS) of the Regular Victim or a Bonus Victim (Figure 1.9). No obstacles are allowed within the Line of Sight.
          </p>
        
          <p>
          Each Victim Marker can be rescued only once by one Crazyflie.
          </p>

        <p>
          If the Crazyflie rescues a Regular Victim, 5 points will be added to the total score. However, if the Crazyflie rescues a Bonus Victim, 15 points will be added to the total score.

        subtitle="Figure 1.7: Specifications of Danger Zones"></image-component>
        <p>
          For SAFMC 2025, four non-electronic markers will be used as Danger Zones. Figure 1.10 shows the general specifications of the Danger Zones, which must not exceed 30 cm x 30 cm x 1 m. Figure 1.10 does not show the actual Danger Zones we are using for the competition.
          </p>
        
        <p>

          Depending on system requirements, the Crazyflie can be interfaced through multiple frameworks, including the native Bitcraze Crazyflie framework, ROS, or a range of external frameworks developed by the open-source community. Each option offers unique capabilities, allowing flexibility based on the project’s specific needs. In this project, Ubuntu 22.04 and ROS2 Humble (Figure 2.5) are used to develop the subsystems as they are the most widely supported development environments.

          <h2>3 Mission Strategy</h2>
          <p>
            With the vastly different Arena layout this year, our mission strategy also must change accordingly. The main 
            areas of consideration are the search strategy to use, object detection methods and use of navigation aids. 
          </p>

          <div id="sub-section-3-header-1">
              <h3>3.1 Search Strategy</h3>
              <p>
                With the introduction of an entirely new Arena which can be split into 3 main areas – namely the Known Search Area,
                Unknown Search Area and Pillar Area, there is a need to test and decide what search strategies to opt for. 
                </p>
            
              <p>
                Last year’s search strategy was an unmapped, decentralized strategy (differences between strategies will be elaborated on in section 4.1), 
                and it did work and were able to complete the search the fastest amongst the teams that participated last year.  
              </p>

              <p>
                However, they did not win the first place as their approach lacked novelty, and did not use the hardware available to 
                them to its fullest potential. Therefore, they lost marks in the team live presentation and eventually came in second.
              </p>
            
              <p>
              Hence, we will be exploring both mapped and unmapped strategies and possibly use a combination of them due to the variety 
              of obstacles present, to improve the overall efficiency and novelty of the search strategy employed.
              </p>
          </div>

          <div id="sub-section-3-header-2">
              <h3>3.2 Object Detection</h3>
              <p>
                The introduction of new obstacles does not only require a revamp of the search strategy, but also a revised approach on the 
                object detection methods. With the presence of an Unknown Search Area, Danger Zones and Pillar Obstacles, we will need to re-evalute our current 
                object detection method and explore other methods before finalising on the method that is best suited for our use case. 
              </p>    
          </div>

          <div id="sub-section-3-header-3">
              <h3>3.3 Navigation Aids</h3>
              <p>
                With the presence of new obstacles, the use of Navigation Aids to help us in our search of the Victims Markers varies significantly. 
                There are many more use cases for navigations aids this year, especially in more tricky areas like the Unknown Seach Area and the Pillar Area. 
              </p>

              <p>
                However, the number of Navigation Aids remain the same as last year, despite there being 3 distinct challenges unlike only 1 last year. 
                We will evaluate on the most effective way to use the navigation aids, as well as what kind of items are we using. We will then need to 
                test and decide the most effective way to use these Navigation Aids.

              <p>
                Our goal is to complete the mission in the quickest time possible while using novel and superior methods for our mission. Therefore, we have 
                split the key areas of development into the 4 roles below.

              Table 2.0 shows the designation of roles for the development of the various sub-systems.
              </p>

              <p>
                The search strategy sub team will be exploring 2 mapping strategies while enhancing the unmapped strategy used last year as we the mapped approach 
                is more difficult to implement and hence will be awarded more marks in the team presentation.  
              </p>

              <p>
                The object detection sub team will be improving on the object detection method used last year as it was inaccurate and slow. Exploration of new methods 
                such as object classification using neural networks will be done simultaneously.   
              </p>

              <p>
                The obstacle detection and avoidance sub team will investigate strategies used to detect and avoid the new obstacles present, which are the Pillar Obstacles.   
              </p>

              <p>
                The simulation sub team will investigate the use of simulation to simulate various search algorithms to improve testing efficiency.

          <p>
            Using Webots, a swarm of Crazyflie was simulated to run the identical MSBA code used in the actual deployment. Since Webots does not support software-in-the-loop and integration with Crazyflie firmware, a few modifications were made to allow the testing of the actual code intended for Crazyflie deployment within the simulation environment.
          </p>
  
          <p>
            A Webots controller was developed to interface the simulated hardware, including sensors and motors, with the MSBA algorithm. The navigation architecture of the simulated Crazyflie is shown in Figure 7.1. 
            The controller code, available in this <a href="https://github.com/CDE-4301-ASI-401/Webots_CF2/blob/main/controllers/SGBA_Controller/SGBA_Controller.c" target="_blank">GitHub repository</a>, processes sensor data from the simulated Crazyflie and feeds it to the MSBA algorithm. Using these inputs, the MSBA script calculates the necessary velocity in the x and y directions and the yaw rate required to achieve the desired motion. This information is then passed back to the Webots controller, which initializes the Bitcraze-developed PID flight controller to determine the required individual motor velocities. Finally, the Webots controller applies these motor velocities to control the Crazyflie's movement, allowing it to execute the MSBA strategy in the simulated environment.

          <h2>Appendix A: Decision Matrix for Selection of Drone Development Platform</h2>


          <drone_platform_selection subtitle="">
            <div id="drone_platform_selection"></div>
          </drone_platform_selection>    

          <p> 
            The selection of drone platform was based on six equal-weighed key factors, size and weight, hardware modularity, software modularity, sensor capability, cost, and parts availability. For each factor, the drone platform is given a score out of 5, the higher the better.           
          </p>

          <ul style="list-style-type: decimal; padding: 0; margin: 0; text-align: justify;">
            <li>
              A smaller and lighter drone enhances manoeuvrability, especially in confined spaces, and improves swarm scalability. Among the evaluated platforms, the Bitcraze Crazyflie is the smallest and lightest, followed by the DJI Tello, which has a slightly larger size and higher weight.
              <br></br>
            </li>
            <li>
              A modular hardware design allows for easy upgrades and component replacements. Higher scores indicate greater flexibility in adding or replacing components. Crazyflie and DEXI are highly modular, as both suppliers provide spare parts and easily swappable components. DEXI scores higher since certain parts, like its onboard computer (Raspberry Pi), are off-the-shelf, whereas Bitcraze relies on a custom PCB. DJI Tello, in contrast, only offers spare parts for specific components like propellers and propeller guards.
              <br></br>
            </li>
            <li>
              Open-source software and compatibility with frameworks like ROS are crucial to provide better software flexibility, developer support, and ease of integration. Crazyflie and DEXI both have high scores as both have open-source software. However, DEXI ranks higher as its on-board computer (Raspberry Pi) provides greater processing power and flexibility compared to Crazyflie’s STM microcontroller. DJI Tello has a low score of 2 due to it running on a proprietary software.
              <br></br>
            </li>
            <li>
              The drone must support onboard sensors for localization, obstacle detection, and avoidance. A higher score is given to platforms with more built-in or easily integrable sensors.  Crazyflie and DEXI have high scores as both offer the same sensor suite such as optical flow sensors, multi-TOF distance sensors, camera etc. On the other hand, DJI Tello only contains a camera module, limiting its capabilities to vision-based solutions.
              <br></br>
            </li>
            <li>
              The cost of each platform should be reasonable as they will be scaled up to form a swarm. In terms of pricing per unit, DJI Tello is the most affordable at USD 109, while Crazyflie, including the additional sensor decks cost USD 640. The DEXI Level III is the most expensive at USD 2000.
              <br></br>
            </li>
            <li>
              Readily available drones and spare parts ensure ease of maintenance. DJI and Bitcraze both have authorized retailers in Singapore, making their spare parts highly accessible. However, DEXI only operate in the United States, requiring international shipping for spare parts, which leads to increased lead time and cost.
